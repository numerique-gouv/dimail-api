"""This module contains the functions to manage the allows in the database.

The allows are the permissions given to a user to manage the mailboxes and the aliases
The allows are stored in the table `allows` in the database. The table has the following
columns:
    - `user`: the user that is allowed to manage the domain
    - `domain`: the domain that the user is allowed to manage

The allows are managed by the following functions:
    - get_allows: get all the allows in the database
    - get_allowed: get an allow in the database
    - allow_domain_for_user: allow a domain for a user
    - deny_domain_for_user: deny a domain for a user
    - delete_allows_by_user: delete all the allows for a user

The allows are used to manage the mailboxes and the aliases. The allows are used to
determine if a user can manage the mailboxes and the aliases on a domain. If the user
is allowed to manage the domain, the user can manage the mailboxes and the aliases on
that domain. If the user is not allowed to manage the domain, the user cannot manage the
mailboxes and the aliases on that domain.
